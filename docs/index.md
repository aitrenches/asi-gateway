## 2. Key Features

- Multi-currency support
- Volatility protection (instant conversion to fiat)
- Integration with existing e-commerce platforms
- Compliance with regulatory requirements
- Security features (multi-sig wallets, cold storage)
- API access for custom integrations
- Transaction monitoring and reporting

## 3. Challenges

- Regulatory uncertainty in different jurisdictions
- Volatility of cryptocurrency prices

## 4. Market Trends

- Increasing adoption of cryptocurrencies for payments
