### Our Goal with This Feedback:

From your responses, we aim to:

1. Pinpoint the key features that should be prioritized in the payment gateway
2. Understand any potential obstacles and concerns you might have
3. Measure interest and predict adoption rates
4. Use this data to inform both technical and design choices

### Timeline:

The survey will be open for four weeks. Afterward, we’ll analyze the feedback and share a summary of our findings with the community.
